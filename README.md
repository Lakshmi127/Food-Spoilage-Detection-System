# Food-Spoilage-Detection-System

Our advanced Food Spoilage Detection System seamlessly incorporates Arduino Uno, NodeMCU, MQ-2 gas sensor, LED light, and buzzer, augmented by the Blynk platform. When the MQ-2 sensor detects methane, indicating spoilage, the Arduino triggers the LED and buzzer. Simultaneously, Blynk sends an instant notification to the user's mobile device via Wi-Fi connection. This innovative integration ensures timely action, minimizing waste and safeguarding food safety, all while keeping users informed on the go.
